# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- **A voice is named `engine/name`**: `neutrino/MERROW` in the setting `cantilena.voice` (a bare name
  still means a NEUTRINO voice), in **Choose Voice…** (with the speaker's name and language beside it),
  in `status().voice` and in `sing`'s `voice`, so a second engine's voice will need no new setting. An
  engine that is not there is said so: `no engine named foo in foo/MERROW (there is: neutrino)`.
- **`voices()` on the API**: the voices installed, each `{ id, engine, name, label, language? }` (the
  label and the language from NEUTRINO's `info.toml`). `apiVersion` stays 1.

## 0.1.0

- First release: the `cantilena` program bundled (Windows x64), the settings (`cantilena.neutrinoFolder`,
  `cantilena.voice`, `cantilena.gpu`, `cantilena.threads`, `cantilena.program`), the commands
  **Choose NEUTRINO Folder…**, **Choose Voice…**, **Check Setup**, **Forget Rendered Voices**, and the API
  (`status`, `sing`, `release`; `apiVersion` 1) that Lily# sings its lyrics through.
